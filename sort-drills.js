// A.)

// [1, 3, 9, 14, 17, 20, 22, 24]

// The above would the array sorted at the end.  After
// a partition call, the pivot is always "in its home".
// Since 14 and 17 in the example output are "in their homes"
// it could be either.

// B.) 
// [3, 9, 10, 12, 19, 14, 17, 16, 13, 15] // 2ba

// ??? [14, 13, 10, 3, 9, 12, 15, 16, 19, 17] // 2bb
